# Roland

## Dataset Format

The dataset should be prepared as a `tsv` file (`csv` is also supported with only minor midification to the loader, add keyword arg `sep=','` to the `dd.read_csv` method), with the first row as column names.

Check `TODO:` 's in the `roland_generic` laoder to adapt it to your own dataset.

The following columns are required to construct a basic dynamic graph.

**Required Fields (Columns)**

* `SRC_NODE` and `DST_NODE`: unique IDs of individuals. In BSI dataset, these two columns are named as `Payer` and `Payee`
* `TIMESTAMP`: a timestamp (integer), e.g., `1230681600` denotes `2008-12-30T16:00:00`. In BSI dataset, this column is named as `Timestamp`.
* `AMOUNT`: transaction amount, this column is named as `AmountEUR` in BSI dataset.

**Optional Fields (Columns)**

* For node features, such as the country of company, add `SRC_NODECompany` and `DST_NODECompany` columns to the dataset. In BSI dataset, the company columns are `PayerCompany` and `PayeeCompany`.
* For edge features associated with transactions, such as the currency used in this transaction, simply add `Currency` column to the dataset.

## Example Dataset (BSI)

* See `./GraphGym_dev/run/datasets/bsi_synthetic.tsv` for an example of BSI dataset.

## Run Our Examples on BSI Dataset

1. Since the BSI dataset is confidential, we generated a synthetic version of it for demonstration purpose. The synthetic sample has exactly the same format as BSI dataset except itâ€™s generated randomly, so you should **NOT** expect any algorithm to achieve any nontrivial out of sample accuracy on it. Feel free to modify the gen sample script to change the size of generated transaction graphs. **Firstly, generte a systhetic BSI dataset**, there should be one there already located at: `GraphGym_dev/run/datasets/bsi_synthetic.tsv`. You can regenerate the dataset using the following code.

    ```bash
    cd GraphGym_dev/run/datasets
    python ./syn_bsi.py
    ```

2. Use the predefined YAML and RUN files, see `/GraphGym_dev/run/run_single_example.sh`.

    Here the **ordinary recurrent GNN** denotes models based on homogenous graphs (i.e., graph without edge/node types), **complete heterogenous RGNN** contains separate networks for message types `(sender_type, edge_type, receiver_type)`, so there are `NumNodeTypes*NumEdgeTypes*NumNodeTypes` internal GNNs. The **partial heterogenous GNN** only consists of `NumNodeTypes` node feature extractors and `NumEdgeTypes` edge feature extractors.

    ```bash
    cd ./GraphGym_dev/run/
    # Ordinal recurrent GNN based on homogenous graph.
    python main.py --cfg configs/roland/examples/gnn_recurrent_example.yaml --repeat 1
    # Complete heterogenous RGNN.
    python main.py --cfg configs/roland/examples/complete_hete_example.yaml --repeat 1
    # Partial heterogenous RGNN.
    python main.py --cfg configs/roland/examples/partial_hete_example.yaml --repeat 1
    ```

## Run Models On Your Own Dataset

To deploy existing models on your own datasets, you would need to:

1. Make a copy of the generic loader at `GraphGym_dev/graphgym/contrib/loader/roland_generic.py`, modify all `TODO` in the python file to make it compatiable with your own dataset. (see section below.)

2. Create the corresponding YAML and RUN files:

    ```bash
    cd ./GraphGym_dev/run/
    python main.py --cfg YOUR_CONFIG.yaml --repeat 1
    ```

## Modify `yaml` Configuration Files

Here we provide a detailed example explaining how to modify a config yaml file. In most cases, you only need to modify a few lines to make it work on your own dataset. Here we only include fields needed to be change.
